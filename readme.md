# Pokedex
** This file is a simple javascript pokedex using jQuery **

This is the first web application I have worked on! I used HTML, JavaScript with jQuery, and CSS to put together this achievment as apart of my studies with CareerFoundry!

This app fetches data from an pokemon API. I created button's using information from the API and then created a modal that takes various information from the API and displays it into the modal.
