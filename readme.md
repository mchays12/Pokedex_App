# Pokedex
This file is a simple javascript Pokedex.

This is the first web application I have worked on! I used HTML, JavaScript with jQuery, and CSS to put together this achievement as a part of my studies with CareerFoundry!

This app fetches data from a Pokemon API. I created buttons using information from the API and then created a modal that takes various information from the API and displays it in the modal.

## Prerequisites
- install node.js

## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies

## Languages
- CSS
- JavaScript with jQuery
- HTML

## Development

To see the pokedex open the index.html in your browser.
